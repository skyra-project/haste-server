## What is this repo?

This repo holds the source code used to provide a reliable, self-controlled and self-hosted HasteServer for Skyra. We saw the need to make our own version because the official image is heavily outdated. It is using outdated bundling, outdated packages, does not use TypeScript and its general code quality is not up to Skyra Project standards. That said, this image would not exist without the awesome work that [John Crepezzi](https://github.com/seejohnrun) has put in the official [haste-server](https://github.com/seejohnrun/haste-server) and we thank him greatly for that.
